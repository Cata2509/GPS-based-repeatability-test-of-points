This code is for automating the process of verifying the repeatability of points collected using the GPS. 
Multiple points need to be collected repeatedly, the project must be exported in CSV format, and with the help of the application, you will convert the raw CSV file into an Excel file with the processed data.
When you run the code, a new window will show up, and all you have to do is select the CSV file and provide the path to generate the Excel file.
